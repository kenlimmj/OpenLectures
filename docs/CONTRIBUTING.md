#How to Contribute
Thank you for your interest in making openlectures better!

##Guidelines
Like any open-source project, we must have guidelines for contributions. It helps protect the quality of code, and gives us at openlectures the confidence of making changes without breaking too many things.

### Steps
1. Fork our repository. You can do so with the Fork button on the top right hand corner.

2. Clone the fork into your local filesystem: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/openlectures.git openlectures`

3. Do your thing.

4. If you need to merge recent updates from the main repository:

    ``` bash
     git remote add core https://github.com/jethrokuan/openlectures.git
     git fetch core
     git rebase core/master
    ```

5. Once you're satisfied, push your code up, and open a pull request on github.

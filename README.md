[openlectures](http://www.openlectures.org/) provides free online lectures based on the Singapore syllabus. It was founded in 2011 by Linan Qiu, a student who strongly believed in making quality education available for anyone who wants to learn.

This is the code base for the openlectures website. As with our lectures, we intend to make our code free and accessible.

Web Stack:

1. [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) for our front-end Javascript framework

2. [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for our back-end API
